Welcome to My EMHASS and Predbat Setup
Overview
My goal is to optimize energy consumption in my home using two powerful tools: EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant) and Predbat (Home Battery Prediction). By integrating these with Home Assistant, I’ve created a system that not only reduces energy costs but also maximizes battery efficiency.

EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)
EMHASS is an open-source tool that integrates with Home Assistant to provide intelligent recommendations and optimizations for energy usage.

GitHub: EMHASS Repository
Features:
Optimizes energy usage based on electricity prices, solar production, and consumption.
Generates schedules for when appliances should run to save money.
Predbat (Home Battery Prediction)
Predbat uses machine learning to predict and optimize the charging and discharging of home batteries. It’s compatible with various inverters, including Huawei.

GitHub: Predbat Repository
Features:
Predicts battery charging needs based on electricity prices, solar production, and energy demand.
Automates charging during low-price periods and discharging during high-price periods.
My Setup
1. Home Assistant
Home Assistant is the core of my smart home system, managing all my integrations and automations.

2. Nordpool Integration
The Nordpool integration fetches spot electricity prices. This is a key component for optimizing energy usage and battery management.

Documentation: Nordpool Integration
3. Huawei Inverter and 10kW Battery
My Huawei inverter and 10kW battery are the backbone of my energy system. These are integrated with Home Assistant and work with Predbat to manage charging and discharging.

Current Status & Challenges
This project is still a work in progress. Here’s what I’m currently working on:

Improving Predbat Configuration:
Fine-tuning logic and automations to make the system more stable.
Reducing the number of manual scripts by consolidating functionality.
Fully Integrating EMHASS:
Experimenting with schedules generated by EMHASS to control household appliances.
What’s Next?
Implement dynamic controls based on EMHASS recommendations.
Explore additional integrations to maximize my solar production.
Document and share my learnings so others can benefit from my experiences.
Tips for Others
Don’t be afraid to experiment and fail!
Use forums and GitHub repositories for help and inspiration.
Be patient – getting all components to work together takes time and adjustments.
Thanks for reading! 😊
