# **Welcome to My EMHASS and Predbat Setup**  

## **Overview**  
This project is focused on optimizing energy consumption in my smart home by combining two powerful tools:  
- **[EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass)**
- **[Predbat (Home Battery Prediction)](https://github.com/arti5020/predbat)**  

By integrating these tools with Home Assistant, I’ve created a system that reduces energy costs and maximizes the efficiency of my 10kW home battery.

## **Components of My Setup**  

### 1. **Home Assistant**  
Home Assistant is the core platform, managing all automations and integrations in my smart home.  

### 2. **[Nordpool Integration](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool)**  
I use the Nordpool integration to fetch real-time electricity prices, a key component for both energy optimization and battery management.  

### 3. **Huawei Inverter and 10kW Battery**  
A Huawei inverter and a 10kW battery form the foundation of my energy system, allowing solar energy storage and optimized usage during peak price periods.

## **What is EMHASS?**  
**EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)** is an open-source tool that provides intelligent recommendations for energy optimization.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Optimizes energy usage based on electricity prices, solar production, and household consumption.  
  - Creates schedules to run appliances at the most cost-efficient times.  

- **GitHub Repository**: [EMHASS Repository](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass)

## **What is Predbat?**  
**Predbat (Home Battery Prediction)** is a machine-learning-based tool that predicts and automates battery charging and discharging.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Predicts battery usage based on electricity prices, solar production, and energy demand.  
  - Automates battery charging during low-price periods and prioritizes discharging during high-price periods.  

- **GitHub Repository**: [Predbat Repository](https://github.com/arti5020/predbat)

## **Current Status**  
This project is a **work in progress**, and I’m continuously improving the setup. Current priorities include:  
1. **Refining Predbat Configuration**:  
   - Improving stability by fine-tuning automations and reducing the number of manual scripts.  
2. **Integrating EMHASS**:  
   - Testing EMHASS schedules to automate household appliance usage effectively.  

---

## **Next Steps**  
- **Implement Dynamic Controls**: Enable automation based on EMHASS recommendations.  
- **Enhance Solar Production Integration**: Explore additional tools to maximize solar energy usage.  
- **Share Insights**: Document my progress and challenges to help others replicate or improve upon my setup.  

---

## **Tips for Others**  
- Don’t hesitate to experiment—trial and error is part of the process!  
- Utilize forums and GitHub repositories for support and ideas.  
- Be patient—it takes time to get all components working smoothly together.
